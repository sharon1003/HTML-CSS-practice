    <h1>Taiwan History</h1>
    <blockquote>"Be the change you want to see in the world." Gandhi</blockquote>
    <p>Taiwan’s history dates back thousands of years, with its earliest inhabitants being Austronesian indigenous peoples. These groups, such as the Amis, Atayal, and Paiwan, developed unique cultures, languages, and traditions that still exist today. In the 17th century, European powers arrived, with the Dutch establishing a colony in southern Taiwan and the Spanish in the north. The Dutch introduced new agricultural techniques and engaged in trade with China and Japan. However, in 1662, Ming Dynasty loyalist Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong) defeated the Dutch and established a short-lived kingdom in Taiwan, making it a refuge for those resisting the Qing Dynasty.</p>
    <p class="relative-example">In 1683, the Qing Dynasty annexed Taiwan, incorporating it into Fujian Province before later making it a separate province in 1885. Taiwan became a strategic location for maritime trade and military defense. However, after China’s defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki ceded Taiwan to Japan. During Japan’s 50-year rule (1895–1945), Taiwan underwent major modernization, with improvements in infrastructure, public health, and education. The Japanese government industrialized Taiwan’s economy, particularly in agriculture and sugar production, while also suppressing Taiwanese resistance and seeking to assimilate the population into Japanese culture.</p>
    <p>After Japan’s defeat in World War II, Taiwan was placed under Republic of China (ROC) rule in 1945. However, political tensions grew, culminating in the 228 Incident (1947), a brutal suppression of Taiwanese protesters by the Kuomintang (KMT) government. In 1949, the Chinese Civil War ended with the Communist Party taking control of mainland China, while the KMT government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, retreated to Taiwan, establishing it as the base of the ROC. Taiwan underwent martial law for nearly four decades before democratization began in the late 20th century. Today, Taiwan is a thriving democracy, known for its economic strength, technological innovation, and commitment to human rights.</p>
