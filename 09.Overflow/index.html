    <h2>方形美甲</h2>
    <p class="one">
        方形美甲的特色是指甲兩側都是"方形的直角"。這種形狀適合本身手指長或是甲床有一定寬度的人。它的好處是指甲不易斷裂，很好保養，但因為前端是直角，所以愛穿針織衫的女孩要特別注意，一不小心容易勾到衣服。

    <h2>Nail</h2>
    <p class="two">
        Nails are composed of keratin, the same protein that makes up hair and the outermost layer of the skin. They grow from the nail matrix, a small but vital tissue located beneath the cuticle. This matrix continuously produces cells that harden as they move outward, forming the visible part of the nail, known as the nail plate.
        The growth rate of nails varies from person to person, influenced by factors like age, diet, and even the seasons. On average, fingernails grow about 3.5 millimeters per month, while toenails grow more slowly, at around 1.5 millimeters per month. Interestingly, nails tend to grow faster in warmer climates and during pregnancy due to increased blood circulation.
        Nails serve a practical purpose beyond aesthetics. They protect the fingertips, enhance fine motor skills, and even provide clues about overall health. Changes in nail color, texture, or shape can indicate nutrient deficiencies, circulatory problems, or even serious illnesses such as diabetes and liver disease.
